## Software Entropy 

-I was drawn to this section because I am familiar with the term entropy from my chemistry
and physics classes. Entropy is the amount of ever-increasing disorder in a system. 
When making a proect, one must fight against disorder and strive toward order. 
Programmers must keep their software orderly and avoid software rot. 

-The entropy of the universe is always increasing. When working on projects,
it is important that everyone is diligent and hardworking. The team must have a 
universal mindset and dedication to the project. If one person starts to slack, 
that rot will disperse and affect the whole team and software. 

I learned about the “Broken Window Theory” first in my sociology class.
We discussed an abandoned house in a low income area that was often victim to 
vandalism and theft.  A team of researchers retored one of the houses with art,
it was painted to look like a house of cards with the windows being different 
playing cards such as the Queen of Hearts. Everyone in the area appreciated 
the art and recognized that this house was being taken care of by others. 
They did not want to destory this beautiful art pieve that contributed to the
neighborhood. We must treat our code with care and not disregard it as
being rot or poorly written.

As we write our code, we must avoid broken windows. We must fix errors and faults as
we see them and not leave them for later while errors acculumlate. As we fix errors, 
we cannot break the whole system. We must take care to retain the integrity of the parts
of the software that are working adn but put out fires as we see them.
