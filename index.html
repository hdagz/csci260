<h1>Software Entropy </h1> 

<p>I was drawn to this section because I am familiar with the term entropy from my <br />
 chemistry and physics classes. Entropy is the amount of ever-increasing disorder <br />
 in a system. When making a proect, one must fight against disorder and strive <br />
 toward order. Programmers must keep their software orderly and avoid software rot.</p> 

<p>The entropy of the universe is always increasing. When working on projects, <br />
it is important that everyone is diligent and hardworking. The team must have a <br />
universal mindset and dedication to the project. If one person starts to slack, <br />
that rot will disperse and affect the whole team and software. </p>

<p>I learned about the “Broken Window Theory” first in my sociology class.<br />
We discussed an abandoned house in a low income area that was often victim to <br />
vandalism and theft.  A team of researchers retored one of the houses with art,<br />
it was painted to look like a house of cards with the windows being different <br />
playing cards such as the Queen of Hearts. Everyone in the area appreciated <br />
the art and recognized that this house was being taken care of by others. <br />
They did not want to destory this beautiful art piece that contributed to the<br />
neighborhood. We must treat our code with care and not disregard it as<br />
being rot or poorly written.  </p>

<p> As we write our code, we must avoid broken windows. We must fix errors and faults as<br />
we see them and not leave them for later while errors acculumlate. As we fix errors, <br />
we cannot break the whole system. We must take care to retain the integrity of the parts<br />
of the software that are working and but put out fires as we see them.  </p>
