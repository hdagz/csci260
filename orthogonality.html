<title> Orthogonality </title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I remember learning about this term in my programming languages class.  <br />
It was one of the parameters by which to evaluate languages’ readability.  <br />
Orthogonality refers to independence. If you change A, it will not affect B. <br />
If one part of your code is broken, all is not lost. It is not falling dominos. <br />
Everything is self-contained and self-sufficient. Orthogonality eliminates <br />
	relation or effects between unrelated things.  </p>

 <p>Orthogonality increases productivity and reduces risk. <br />
 Orthogonality increases productivity because it is easier to write  <br />
 small components that accomplish one task each as opposed to a huge <br />
 chunk of code that does everything. You can also reuse parts on  <br />
 different projects to perform a specific task.   </p>
 
<p>When working in teams, orthogonality makes it easier to divide and  <br />
distribute tasks. Instead of everyone working to accomplish the big task, you can <br /> 
break that task up into manageable bits for everyone. When making your part, avoid <br />
global terms.Global terms are used throughout different classes of a project and <br />
can be manipulated upon each iteration. Using global terms tethers your code to <br />
other code that uses the global term too. By avoiding global terms, you avoid tying <br />
it to other sections. Orthogonality can improve testing as well.   </p>

	<p>I picked this topic because I remember talking about it in programming languages. <br />
  However, I didn’t really understand it. I wanted to refresh myself with the topic.  <br />
  It is interesting that the book states that this topic is often passed over in class <br />
  in favor of concrete techniques. That is surprising because orthogonality is a trait <br />
  that would benefit all projects. You will use orthogonality in your daily work because  <br />
  it is a design principle rather than a now obsolete function in C+++ that you learned  <br />
  20 years ago in undergrad.  </p>
